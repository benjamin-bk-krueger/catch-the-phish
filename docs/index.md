## About

Catch-the-Phish is an online training platform that allows you to create phishing scenarios based on images or PDF documents. Multiple scenarios can be grouped into campaigns that are public or only available to a closed user group. The platform offers a final rating for each scenario, depending on whether the user has correctly classified it as legitimate or phishing. In addition, indicators can be set that make a message recognisable as phishing.
The platform also offers the option of using and creating learning material in the form of videos and quizzes.
