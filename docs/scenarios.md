# Scenarios

## All Scenarios

You can see which scenarios are available by clicking on _Scenarios_. Anonymous users can only see scenarios that are assigned to a public campaign. Registered users (with the role `Student` or `Admin`) can see all scenarios in the overview.

If you click on an entry, you will get to the detailed view.  
Note: When you have completed a scenario, the score will also be displayed in the overview.

## Editing indicators

You can create additional indicators for a scenario (mainly phishing) that make the mail or message clear as a phishing message. A user can basically choose whether a scenario is a legitimate or a phishing one. In addition, he can click on the image where he suspects such indicators, which gives additional points.

To create an indicator, drag a box over the area with the mouse. Then select in the area how many points there are when the indicator is clicked. In addition, a text can be entered when the mouse is held over this area. 
Then click on _Add_ to create this indicator.

When an indicator has been created, these areas are highlighted in colour.

## Playing and rating a scenario

The actual function of the platform for users is training by playing scenarios.

Here, the scenario image is displayed and the user can decide whether it is a legitimate or a phishing scenario.

In addition, they can click on places in the image that they consider particularly conspicuous for the respective type (e.g. phishing).

The scenario is then evaluated (based on the basic assessment and the indicators caught).
